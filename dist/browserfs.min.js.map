Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n\t// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n\t// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n\t// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n\t// the system to stop doing the transform.

FOOTER //\n// ../../../../src/backend/XmlHttpRequest.ts","/**\n * Zip file-backed filesystem\n * Implemented according to the standard:\n * http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT\n *\n * While there are a few zip libraries for JavaScript (e.g. JSZip and zip.js),\n * they are not a good match for BrowserFS. In particular, these libraries\n * perform a lot of unneeded data copying, and eagerly decompress every file\n * in the zip file upon loading to check the CRC32. They also eagerly decode\n * strings. Furthermore, these libraries duplicate functionality already present\n * in BrowserFS (e.g. UTF-8 decoding and binary data manipulation).\n *\n * This filesystem takes advantage of BrowserFS's Buffer implementation, which\n * efficiently represents the zip file in memory (in both ArrayBuffer-enabled\n * browsers *and* non-ArrayBuffer browsers), and which can neatly be 'sliced'\n * without copying data. Each struct defined in the standard is represented with\n * a buffer slice pointing to an offset in the zip file, and has getters for\n * each field. As we anticipate that this data will not be read often, we choose\n * not to store each struct field in the JavaScript object; instead, to reduce\n * memory consumption, we retrieve it directly from the binary data each time it\n * is requested.\n *\n * When the filesystem is instantiated, we determine the directory structure\n * of the zip file as quickly as possible. We lazily decompress and check the\n * CRC32 of files. We do not cache decompressed files; if this is a desired\n * feature, it is best implemented as a generic file system wrapper that can\n * cache data from arbitrary file systems.\n *\n * For inflation, we use `pako`'s implementation:\n * https://github.com/nodeca/pako\n *\n * Current limitations:\n * * No encryption.\n * * No ZIP64 support.\n * * Read-only.\n *   Write support would require that we:\n *   - Keep track of changed/new files.\n *   - Compress changed files, and generate appropriate metadata for each.\n *   - Update file offsets for other files in the zip file.\n *   - Stream it out to a location.\n *   This isn't that bad, so we might do this at a later date.\n */\nimport {ApiError, ErrorCode} from '../core/api_error';\nimport {default as Stats, FileType} from '../core/node_fs_stats';\nimport {SynchronousFileSystem, FileSystem} from '../core/file_system';\nimport {File} from '../core/file';\nimport {FileFlag, ActionType} from '../core/file_flag';\nimport {NoSyncFile} from '../generic/preload_file';\nimport {Arrayish, arrayish2Buffer, copyingSlice} from '../core/util';\nimport ExtendedASCII from '../generic/extended_ascii';\nconst inflateRaw: {\n  (data: Arrayish<number>, options?: {\n    chunkSize: number;\n  }): Arrayish<number>;\n} = require('pako/lib/inflate').inflateRaw;\nimport {FileIndex, DirInode, FileInode, isDirInode, isFileInode} from '../generic/file_index';\n\n/**\n * Maps CompressionMethod => function that decompresses.\n */\nconst decompressionMethods: {[method: number]: (data: Buffer, compressedSize: number, uncompressedSize: number, flags: number) => Buffer} = {};\n\n/**\n * 4.4.2.2: Indicates the compatibiltiy of a file's external attributes.\n */\nexport enum ExternalFileAttributeType {\n  MSDOS = 0, AMIGA = 1, OPENVMS = 2, UNIX = 3, VM_CMS = 4, ATARI_ST = 5,\n  OS2_HPFS = 6, MAC = 7, Z_SYSTEM = 8, CP_M = 9, NTFS = 10, MVS = 11, VSE = 12,\n  ACORN_RISC = 13, VFAT = 14, ALT_MVS = 15, BEOS = 16, TANDEM = 17, OS_400 = 18,\n  OSX = 19\n}\n\n/**\n * 4.4.5\n */\nexport enum CompressionMethod {\n  STORED = 0,     // The file is stored (no compression)\n  SHRUNK = 1,     // The file is Shrunk\n  REDUCED_1 = 2,  // The file is Reduced with compression factor 1\n  REDUCED_2 = 3,  // The file is Reduced with compression factor 2\n  REDUCED_3 = 4,  // The file is Reduced with compression factor 3\n  REDUCED_4 = 5,  // The file is Reduced with compression factor 4\n  IMPLODE = 6,    // The file is Imploded\n  DEFLATE = 8,    // The file is Deflated\n  DEFLATE64 = 9,  // Enhanced Deflating using Deflate64(tm)\n  TERSE_OLD = 10, // PKWARE Data Compression Library Imploding (old IBM TERSE)\n  BZIP2 = 12,     // File is compressed using BZIP2 algorithm\n  LZMA = 14,      // LZMA (EFS)\n  TERSE_NEW = 18, // File is compressed using IBM TERSE (new)\n  LZ77 = 19,      // IBM LZ77 z Architecture (PFS)\n  WAVPACK = 97,   // WavPack compressed data\n  PPMD = 98       // PPMd version I, Rev 1\n}\n\n/**\n * Converts the input time and date in MS-DOS format into a JavaScript Date\n * object.\n */\nfunction msdos2date(time: number, date: number): Date {\n  // MS-DOS Date\n  // |0 0 0 0  0|0 0 0  0|0 0 0  0 0 0 0\n  //   D (1-31)  M (1-23)  Y (from 1980)\n  let day = date & 0x1F;\n  // JS date is 0-indexed, DOS is 1-indexed.\n  let month = ((date >> 5) & 0xF) -

BrowserFS FileSystems should implement\n * this interface.\n *\n * Below, we denote each API method as **Core**, **Supplemental**, or\n * **Optional**.\n *\n * ### Core Methods\n *\n * **Core** API methods *need* to be implemented for basic read/write\n * functionality.\n *\n * Note that read-only FileSystems can choose to not implement core methods\n * that mutate files or metadata. The default implementation will pass a\n * NOT_SUPPORTED error to the callback.\n *\n * ### Supplemental Methods\n *\n * **Supplemental** API methods do not need to be implemented by a filesystem.\n * The default implementation implements all of the supplemental API methods in\n * terms of the **core** API methods.\n *\n * Note that a file system may choose to implement supplemental methods for\n * efficiency reasons.\n *\n * The code for some supplemental methods was adapted directly from NodeJS's\n * fs.js source code.\n *\n * ### Optional Methods\n *\n * **Optional** API methods provide functionality that may not be available in\n * all filesystems. For example, all symlink/hardlink-related API methods fall\n * under this category.\n *\n * The default implementation will pass a NOT_SUPPORTED error to the callback.\n *\n * ### Argument Assumptions\n *\n * You can assume the following about arguments passed to each API method:\n *\n * * **Every path is an absolute path.** Meaning, `.`, `..`, and other items\n *   are resolved into an absolute form.\n * * **All arguments are present.** Any optional arguments at the Node API level\n *   have been passed in with their default values.\n * * **The callback will reset the stack depth.** When your filesystem calls the\n *   callback with the requested information, it will use `setImmediate` to\n *   reset the JavaScript stack depth before calling the user-supplied callback.\n * @class FileSystem\n */\nexport interface FileSystem {\n  /**\n   * **Optional**: Returns the name of the file system.\n   * @method FileSystem#getName\n   * @return {string}\n   */\n  getName(): string;\n  /**\n   * **Optional**: Passes the following information to the callback:\n   *\n   * * Total number of bytes available on this file system.\n   * * number of free bytes available on this file system.\n   *\n   * @method FileSystem#diskSpace\n   * @todo This info is not available through the Node API.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

The\n   code lengths are lens[0..codes-1].  Each length corresponds to the\n   symbols 0..codes-1.  The Huffman code is generated by first sorting the\n   symbols by length from short to long, and retaining the symbol order\n   for codes with equal lengths.  Then the code starts with all zero bits\n   for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer\n   increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length\n   increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards\n   from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the\n   decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes\n   are incremented backwards.\n\n   This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in\n   lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.\n   1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that\n   symbol does not occur in this code.\n\n   The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,\n   creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the\n   sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted\n   table.  The sorted table is work[], with that space being provided by\n   the caller.\n\n   The length counts are used for other purposes as well, i.e. finding\n   the minimum and maximum length codes, determining if there are any\n   codes at all, checking for a valid set of lengths, and looking ahead\n   at length counts to determine sub-table sizes when building the\n   decoding tables.\n   */\n\n  /* accumulate lengths for codes (assumes lens[] all in 0..MAXBITS) */\n  for (len = 0; len <= MAXBITS; len++) {\n    count[len] = 0;\n  }\n  for (sym = 0; sym < codes; sym++) {\n    count[lens[lens_index + sym]]++;\n  }\n\n  /* bound code lengths, force root to be within code lengths */\n  root = bits;\n  for (max = MAXBITS; max >= 1; max--) {\n    if (count[max] !== 0) { break; }\n  }\n  if (root > max) {\n    root = max;\n  }\n  if (max === 0) {                     /* no symbols to code at all */\n    //table.op[opts.table_index] = 64;  //here.op = (var char)64;    /* invalid code marker */\n    //table.bits[opts.table_index] = 1;   //here.bits = (var char)1;\n    //table.val[opts.table_index++] = 0;   //here.val = (var short)0;\n    table[table_index++] = (1 << 24) | (64 << 16) | 0;\n\n\n    //table.op[opts.table_index] = 64;\n    //table.bits[opts.table_index] = 1;\n    //table.val[opts.table_index++] = 0;\n    table[table_index++] = (1 << 24) | (64 << 16) | 0;\n\n    opts.bits = 1;\n    return 0;     /* no symbols, but wait for decoding to report error */\n  }\n  for (min = 1; min < max; min++) {\n    if (count[min] !== 0) { break; }\n  }\n  if (root < min) {\n    root = min;\n  }\n\n  /* check for an over-subscribed or incomplete set of lengths */\n  left = 1;\n  for (len = 1; len <= MAXBITS; len++) {\n    left <<= 1;\n    left -= count[len];\n    if (left < 0) {\n      return -1;\n    }        /* over-subscribed */\n  }\n  if (left > 0 && (type === CODES || max !== 1)) {\n    return -1;                      /* incomplete set */\n  }\n\n  /* generate offsets into symbol table for each length for sorting */\n  offs[1] = 0;\n  for (len = 1; len < MAXBITS; len++) {\n    offs[len + 1] = offs[len] + count[len];\n  }\n\n  /* sort symbols by length, by symbol order within each length */\n  for (sym = 0; sym < codes; sym++) {\n    if (lens[lens_index + sym] !== 0) {\n      work[offs[lens[lens_index + sym]]++] = sym;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /*\n   Create and fill in decoding tables.  In this loop, the table being\n   filled is at next and has curr index bits.  The code being used is huff\n   with length len.  That code is converted to an index by dropping drop\n   bits off of the bottom.  For codes where len is less than drop + curr,\n   those top drop + curr - len bits are incremented through all values to\n   fill the table with replicated entries.\n\n   root is the number of index bits for the root table.  When len exceeds\n   root, sub-tables are created pointed to by the root entry with an index\n   of the low root bits of huff.  This is saved in low to check for when a\n   new sub-table should be started.  drop is zero when the root table is\n   being filled, and drop is root when sub-tables are being filled.\n\n   When a new sub-table is needed, it is necessary to look ahead in the\n   code lengths to determine what size sub-table is needed.  The length\n   counts are used for this, and so count[] is decremented as codes are\n   entered in the tables.\n\n   used keeps track of how many table entries have been allocated from the\n   provided *table space.  It is checked for LENS and DIST tables against\n   the constants ENOUGH_LENS and ENOUGH_DISTS to guard against changes in\n   the initial root table size constants.  See the comments in inftrees.h\n   for more information.\n\n   sym increments through all symbols, and the loop terminates when\n   all codes of length max, i.e. all codes, have been processed.  This\n   routine permits incomplete codes, so another loop after this one fills\n   in the rest of the decoding tables with invalid code markers.\n   */\n\n  /* set up for code type */\n  // poor man optimization - use if-else instead of switch,\n  // to avoid deopts in old v8\n  if (type === CODES) {\n    base = extra = work;
